# Task-Tracker
## Easy Task and Goal Management

This is a partially-automated system for many goal-achieving tasks, including job hunting, skill-building, remembering appointments, and more!

## How to use the task list

The tasks markdown file is fully customizable, and can be edited like any other source file. Add customized sections and checklists, remove ones you don't need, and leave the web view of the file open to make sure you're on track.

## Work In Progress

This project is in its infancy. At the moment, it requires markdown support. I currently use it in Visual Studio Code using the web view of markdown files.

Note: If viewing the tasks file in VSCode, install the [VSCode Markdown Checkbox extension](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-markdown-checkbox) to enable checkboxes.

## The Future

This project will scale into a deployed Flask application and will be rendered in HTML using a browser. The possibilities are currently infinite.
